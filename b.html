					<p>A Celebration of Wisdom, Prosperity, and Good Fortune.
						Ganesh Chaturthi is one of the most widely celebrated Hindu festivals in India and among the Hindu community worldwide. 
						It is a ten-day festival that honors the birth of Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of wisdom, prosperity, and good fortune. 
						The festival is observed with great fervor and devotion across India, especially in Maharashtra, where it is celebrated on a grand scale.

					<img src="assets/images/blog/blog2.jpg" alt="Article Image">
					<p>According to Hindu mythology, Lord Ganesha was created by Goddess Parvati out of sandalwood paste to guard her while she bathed. 
						When Lord Shiva, Parvati's husband, returned home, he was stopped by Ganesha who did not recognize him. 
						This led to a fierce battle between the two, which ended with Lord Shiva beheading Ganesha. 
						Upon seeing her son's lifeless body, Parvati was inconsolable and demanded that he be brought back to life. 
						Lord Shiva then replaced Ganesha's head with that of an elephant, and thus Lord Ganesha was born.
						Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated to commemorate this event and to seek the blessings of Lord Ganesha for wisdom, prosperity, and good fortune. 
						The festival also symbolizes the triumph of good over evil and the importance of family values and community spirit.

					<img src="assets/images/blog/blog3.jpg" alt="Article Image">
					<p>
						The preparations for Ganesh Chaturthi begin months in advance. 
						Skilled artisans craft clay idols of Lord Ganesha in various sizes and poses, ranging from small ones for homes to giant ones for public pandals (temporary structures). 
						The idols are decorated with colorful flowers, lights, and ornaments.
						On the day of the festival, the idols are installed in homes and public pandals with great pomp and ceremony. 
						Devotees offer prayers, sing bhajans (devotional songs), and perform aarti (rituals involving the waving of lamps) to seek the blessings of Lord Ganesha. 
						The pandals also host cultural programs, including music, dance, and drama.

					<p>
						The festival lasts for ten days, during which devotees offer modak (a sweet dumpling made of rice flour and coconut) and other delicacies as prasad (offering) to Lord Ganesha. 
						On the seventh day, a ritual called 'Utsav Murthi' is performed, in which a smaller idol of Lord Ganesha is taken out in a procession.
						On the tenth day, which is known as Anant Chaturdashi, the idols are taken out in a grand procession for immersion in water bodies such as lakes, rivers, or the sea. 
						This symbolizes the return of Lord Ganesha to his abode in Mount Kailash. 
						The immersion procession is accompanied by music, dance, and revelry.
